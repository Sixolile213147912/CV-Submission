**Situation:** All 3rd year CPUT IT students were tasked with drafting and submitting a completed CV using the skills learnt from the Create a CV course, as part of the Project Presentation 3 module.

**Task:** My goal was to go through the course content of the Create a CV course and use those skills to compile my CV. I had to make sure that it was complete and submitted on time.

**Action:** I took the time to go through the course content, and completed the related assesment in time.

**Result:** Probably one of the most stressful things to do is to submit a CV. I managed to do so before the deadline, but I honestly was not 100% happy with the final CV. I must admit that I did procrastinate when it came to drafting one, which is something I will not do in future.
